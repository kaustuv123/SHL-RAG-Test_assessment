This test calculates a score based on the total number of keystrokes, time taken, and number of errors made when typing six passages. This Split Screen Typing Test uses the following method to determine the Net Words Per Minute score: Net Words Per Minute = ((Gross Words Per Minute * Time Taken) - Total Errors) / Time Taken.",
